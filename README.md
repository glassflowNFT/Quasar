# Event-Contract-Framework 

Our team has made a proof of concept application for events to leverage smart contracts in the following ways: 

**1. Ticket & Attendance Tracking**
    - Displays a QR code of connected wallets public address 
    - 'Event Ushers' are able to Scan & Update Attendance of event guests
**2. Event Management Features**
    - Custom functions for both the event guest, as well as event host's & ushers. 
**3. Transparent Event Voting**
    -  Event admins & ushers can create new entries within entry-categories, to be able to have event-judges vote on which entry is superior. 

**The Plan: *Evolving into permissionless IRL event framework for anyone (especially DAO's & Protocols)***
